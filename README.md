# Data Structures Projects

Includes some of my Data Structures projects! Here is a breakdown:




## Projects

1. Silver Dollar Game: a strategy puzzle game where players take turns moving 'coins' along a row of 'squares', without jumping over other coins. The goal is to be the last player to make a valid move.

2. Infinite Monkey Theorem: Based on the famous theorem, this is a text generator that uses an input txt file to find patterns in the words used and create a new text mimicking writing style.

3. Comparators: Implements different comparators to find ways to sort students from a directory.

4. Sudoku Solver: Instantly solves any Sudoku puzzle!

5. Two Towers:  given \(n\) blocks with face areas from 1 to \(n\), and side lengths equal to the square roots of their face areas. The goal is to use all the blocks to build two towers such that the total heights (sum of side lengths) of both towers are as close as possible. The goal is to distribute the blocks between the two towers in a way that minimizes the difference in height between them.

7. Lexicon: Builds a lexicon from list of words.
